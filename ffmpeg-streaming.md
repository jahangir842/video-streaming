### FFmpeg Streaming Over Local Network

Streaming over a local network is ideal for scenarios like video distribution in a home or office setup, streaming from a server to a client, or creating a local IPTV network. FFmpeg supports multiple streaming protocols suitable for local networks, such as UDP, RTP, and HTTP.

Here are detailed steps to stream multimedia content over your local network using FFmpeg:

---

### 1. **Stream Over UDP**

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a common protocol for video streaming within a local network. It's low-latency and can handle large amounts of data but does not provide error correction, making it suitable for fast, local streams where packet loss is minimal.

#### **Command Example:**

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -f mpegts udp://192.168.1.100:1234
```

- **`-re`**: Reads the input in real-time, crucial for streaming.
- **`-i input.mp4`**: Specifies the input file (replace with your file path).
- **`-c:v libx264`**: Uses H.264 video codec (default and efficient for network streaming).
- **`-c:a aac`**: Uses AAC audio codec.
- **`-f mpegts`**: Outputs in MPEG-TS format, commonly used in streaming.
- **`udp://192.168.1.100:1234`**: Sends the stream to the IP `192.168.1.100` on port `1234`. Change the IP address to match the receiving device.

You can view this stream using a media player like VLC. On the receiving device (e.g., 192.168.1.100), open VLC and go to:
**Media → Open Network Stream** and enter `udp://@:1234`.

### 2. **Stream Over RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**

RTP is another widely used protocol in media streaming, offering better synchronization and control mechanisms than UDP.

#### **Command Example:**

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -f rtp rtp://192.168.1.100:1234
```

- **`-f rtp`**: Outputs in RTP format.
- **`rtp://192.168.1.100:1234`**: Streams to the client at IP `192.168.1.100` on port `1234`.

You can view the stream on a media player that supports RTP, such as VLC. In VLC:
- Go to **Media → Open Network Stream**.
- Enter `rtp://@:1234` to start receiving the stream.

RTP is better suited for low-latency and high-quality streaming compared to UDP.

### 3. **Stream Over HTTP**

HTTP streaming can be used when you want to broadcast video over a local network accessible via a web browser or media player. FFmpeg can be set up as an HTTP server for streaming purposes.

#### **Command Example:**

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -f mpegts http://192.168.1.100:8080
```

- **`-f mpegts`**: Uses the MPEG-TS format.
- **`http://192.168.1.100:8080`**: Streams the file over HTTP on port `8080` to the client with IP `192.168.1.100`.

To watch this stream:
- Open a web browser or VLC on the client machine.
- For VLC, go to **Media → Open Network Stream** and enter `http://192.168.1.100:8080`.

This method allows any device with an HTTP client (browser, media player) to access the stream.

### 4. **HLS Streaming on Local Network**

HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) divides the media into smaller segments and serves it via HTTP, making it resilient to network changes and suitable for adaptive streaming. It’s typically used for internet streaming, but you can also use it locally.

#### **Step-by-Step HLS Setup:**

1. **Generate HLS Playlist and Segments**:
   This command will generate `.m3u8` playlist and `.ts` segments for streaming.

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -f hls -hls_time 10 -hls_list_size 0 -hls_segment_filename "/var/www/html/segment_%03d.ts" "/var/www/html/playlist.m3u8"
   ```

   - **`-hls_time 10`**: Each `.ts` segment is 10 seconds long.
   - **`-hls_list_size 0`**: Keeps all segments in the playlist without removing old ones.
   - **`-hls_segment_filename "/var/www/html/segment_%03d.ts"`**: Stores the `.ts` files with sequential numbering (`%03d`).
   - **`/var/www/html/playlist.m3u8`**: Generates the HLS playlist file (`.m3u8`).

2. **Serve HLS Over HTTP**:
   Serve the HLS files using a simple web server (Apache, Nginx, or Python's HTTP server).

   If using Python:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

   This command starts an HTTP server on port `8080` to serve the `.m3u8` playlist and `.ts` segments.

3. **View the Stream**:
   To view the stream, go to the client and enter the following in VLC or any HLS-compatible player:

   ```bash
   http://192.168.1.100:8080/playlist.m3u8
   ```

HLS is ideal for adaptive streaming and more complex setups but requires a web server for segment serving.

### 5. **Live Streaming from a Webcam or Desktop**

#### **Streaming Webcam Over UDP**:

If you want to stream live video from a webcam, you can use the following command:

```bash
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -c:v libx264 -f mpegts udp://192.168.1.100:1234
```

- **`-f v4l2`**: Captures from Video4Linux (Linux webcam).
- **`/dev/video0`**: Your webcam device.
- **`udp://192.168.1.100:1234`**: Streams to `192.168.1.100` on port `1234`.

You can view the stream on a client device using VLC with the URL `udp://@:1234`.

#### **Streaming Desktop Screen Over HTTP**:

On Linux, you can capture and stream your desktop screen using FFmpeg:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -i :0.0 -c:v libx264 -f mpegts http://192.168.1.100:8080
```

- **`-f x11grab`**: Captures the screen.
- **`-s 1920x1080`**: Sets the resolution.
- **`:0.0`**: Refers to display `0.0`.
- **`http://192.168.1.100:8080`**: Streams over HTTP to the client at `192.168.1.100` on port `8080`.

This is useful for creating a live desktop broadcast accessible from any browser or VLC client on the network.

### 6. **Advanced Network Stream Tuning**

#### **Buffering and Latency Management**:

When streaming over a network, managing buffering and latency can be crucial to maintain stream quality.

- **`-bufsize 1000k`**: Controls the buffer size (larger buffer = better handling of network fluctuations).
- **`-maxrate 3000k`**: Ensures the output bitrate does not exceed 3000 kbps.
- **`-tune zerolatency`**: Minimizes latency, useful for live streaming.

Example command with tuning:

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 3000k -maxrate 3000k -bufsize 1000k -tune zerolatency -f mpegts udp://192.168.1.100:1234
```

This command is optimized for low-latency streaming while controlling the bitrate and buffer size.

### 7. **Stream Replication (Multiple Destinations)**

FFmpeg allows you to stream the same content to multiple clients or servers simultaneously.

#### **Multiple Destination Streaming Example**:

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -f mpegts udp://192.168.1.100:1234 -f mpegts udp://192.168.1.101:1234
```

In this example, the same video is streamed to two clients (`192.168.1.100` and `192.168.1.101`) simultaneously.

---
